# Disease_Prediction_Using_Machine_Learning

*Project Overview:*
Utilized major libraries including *scikit-learn, NumPy, matplotlib, pandas, Tkinter, and os* to develop a machine learning-based disease prediction system.

The project involves training multiple machine learning models on a structured dataset of patient symptoms. Once trained, these models can predict the likely disease based on unseen or test inputs.

A *Graphical User Interface (GUI)* has been built using *Tkinter* to make the system user-friendly. This interface allows users to input patient symptoms and receive real-time predictions of possible diseases, enhancing accessibility and usability.
